# Assets

Place assets in this directory that will be shared by multiple top-level directories. For example, the `assets/fonts` directory is used in both `components` and in `.storybook`, which is why it's located up here in assets.

Any assets that _can_ be located in a more specific folder _should_ be. For example, images used by a single component should be located in that component's directory.
